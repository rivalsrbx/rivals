## 🔒 Tips for Safer Use

1. **Use Alt Accounts** - Never execute the **rivals god script** features on your main Roblox account; create disposable alternatives
2. **Start with Legit Settings** - Configure aimbot with higher FOV (15-20 degrees) and smoothing (70-85%) for natural appearance

4. **Avoid Obvious Behavior** - Even with aimbot, miss occasional shots and avoid 100% headshot rates
5. **Monitor Server Reports** - If players mention reporting, immediately disable aggressive features like auto-farm or speed hacks
6. **Use Private Servers** - Test extreme features in private Rivals matches before using in public servers
7. **Respect Community** - Don't ruin gameplay for legitimate players; use scripts responsibly in casual matches
8. **Update Regularly** - Check **rivals script discord** for urgent security patches after Roblox updates
9. **VPN Consideration** - Optional extra layer of protection, though not strictly necessary for script usage
10. **Session Limits** - Limit continuous usage to 2-3 hours to avoid anti-cheat pattern detection
11. **Config Backups** - Save custom configurations from **rivals best script pastebin** setups to cloud storage
